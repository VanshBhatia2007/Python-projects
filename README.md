# 🐍 Python Projects Collection

Welcome! I'm **Vansh Bhatia**, and this repository is a growing collection of **Python projects** that I’ve built to sharpen my programming skills and explore real-world applications of Python.

Each folder contains code, logic, and mini-documentation to help others (and future me) learn and reuse these projects easily.

## 👤 About Me

I'm a tech enthusiast exploring software development through hands-on projects.  
Python is one of the first languages I got comfortable with — its simplicity and power make it ideal for learning and building.

This repo is where I practice, experiment, and grow — one project at a time.

## 🎯 Goals

- ✅ Strengthen core Python fundamentals  
- ✅ Build real-world, beginner-to-intermediate level projects  
- ✅ Practice consistency through project-based learning  
- ✅ Share reusable code and help others learn
